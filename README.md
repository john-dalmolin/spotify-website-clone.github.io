# **Project: Cloning Spotify Website ðŸ˜Š**

*(This project isn't finished yet...)*

## **A Brief Description About This Project!**

I'm currently in the process of building this project while adding comments to every line of code. My goal isn't just to create a clone of the Spotify website, but to actually build it and make the project more readable.

The mobile version isn't functional because Spotify itself doesn't offer a web version specifically for mobile devices. However, once this project is completed, I plan to develop a web version using a framework. Until then, unfortunately, the 'mobile version' is restricted to iPads and tablets.

## **Preview!**
